            <h3>Back-End Developer</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Since the age of ten, I have dreamed of being an experienced engineer bringing countless ideas to fruition with my extensive programming knowledge. At a young age, I plugged myself into the world of electronics, researching programming languages, reading books on the subject, nodding through convoluted conversations with my electrical engineer uncle, and learning the fundamentals of computer science; but my cravings for knowledge remain unsatisfied. Over the last few years, I have taught myself various skills from web development to Object-Oriented Python programming through experimentation and freelance work. In addition to learning at home, I have attended multiple computer science and programming classes, including one taught entirely in German. I traveled to Germany as a foreign exchange student in my junior year of high school; there, I lived with a host family and attended a German high school for roughly ten months. Now, I speak fluent German and conversational Spanish, which I am currently learning to pursue my other interests in culture and language. My work as a freelance developer has revealed to me my passion for learning new skills and finding creative solutions to problems with computer science, a passion I am determined to pursue further to satisfy my desire for knowledge.</p>
